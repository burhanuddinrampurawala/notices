##INTRODUCTION



  Just around our daily college life we happen to miss a few important notices, due to our carelessness or due to our communication gap.

  We thought of bridging this gap by introducing an app
  on our phone.

  All notices just a tap away.









  ‘Notices’ is an android application to add, delete and edit notices. This application is made for college use
  only.


###It has two types of login:
  •	Admin
  •	Student

  	Admin (Faculty) can add, delete and edit notices.
  	Student can only go through the notice and its contents.

This app will give an option to a teacher to connect with their students.
