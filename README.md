## INTRODUCTION

```
Just around our daily college life we happen to miss a few important notices, due to our carelessness or due to our communication gap.  

We thought of bridging this gap by introducing an app on our phone.  

All notices just a tap away.  

‘Notices’ is an android application to add, delete and edit notices. This application is made for college use only
