##INTRODUCTION



  Just around our daily college life we happen to miss a few important notices, due to our carelessness or due to our communication gap.  

  We thought of bridging this gap by introducing an app on our phone.  

  All notices just a tap away.  


  ‘Notices’ is an android application to add, delete and edit notices. This application is made for college use
  only.  


###It has two types of login:  
  *	Admin  
  *	Student  

  ####Admin (Faculty) can add, delete and edit notices.    
  ####Student can only go through the notice and its contents.  

This app will give an option to a teacher to connect with their students.
