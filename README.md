# notices
yes, I have independently made an app (which is not yet complete) and the Github link is on my resume. 
The app is about logging and registration. 
There are two types of logging  in one for student and other for admin (while the registration is only for students). 
The student can only see the notice while the admin has the privileges to add, delete and edit the notices.
PS : the password are encrypted with a salt
